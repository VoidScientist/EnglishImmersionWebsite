            &emsp; In <b>humanitarian engineering</b> there are a lots of external factors to ponder over.
            Indeed, trying to help others in the <b>long run</b> also means doing your utmost for your solution
            to fit into their everyday lives, <b>their culture</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; Somali people are mostly <b>muslims</b>, hence we need to be careful to <b>not breach</b> any of their <b>core beliefs.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; Although it is also reasonable to assume that our project, being a nigh-fully <b>underground cylinder</b> that
            stores water during flood, won't cause much trouble at a local-scale.

            &emsp; Islam puts a lot of emphasis on the <b>cleanliness of water</b> 
            which brings another reason to really pay attention to the <b>quality of water.</b>

        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; Obviously, this criterion is <b>met</b> as it is most important to keep the people

            &emsp; On a larger scale, the containers need to be installed in <b>potential flooded areas.</b>
