            <b>Is this a preventative measure or a response?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; It is a response. Because of climate change, floods and drought have been happening in Somalia for many years.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b>Why do you think this issue is especially important? </b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; Water, along with food, are two most important basic human needs. Thus, this issue is of this upmost importance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b>Is this issue something that is similar to other issues happening in the world? </b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; Drought and floods are happening in many African countries outside of Africa. We can quote India, Ethiopia or Kenya.

            <b>Do you think some SDG goals are more important than others?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; We believe SDGs 2,3 and 6 are the most important, as they focus on reaching the basic human needs such as food for everyone, clean and accessible water and general healthcare.

            <b>Why did you choose to focus on these SD goals? </b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; We chose these goals for the reasons cited above. In our case, we are focusing on SDG 6 : clean and accessible water – a central issue for every country and population or Earth.

            <b>How did you manage your brainstorming process?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp;We began by considering a country; in our case, Somalia. Then, after researching about potential issues plaguing it, we’ve settled on dealing with lack of water caused by drought, and the subsequent floods happening in the region.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b>What were some other solutions you considered?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp;There wasn’t much backtracking on our steps. The option presented here was the one we’ve settled on since the beginning.

        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp;We began by imagining either a rainwater containing or a saltwater desalination bag. However, after debating, we changed our plans, and thus settled for the underground flood container.

        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp;We added a heating system to cleanse the water of any lingering bacteria.

        <p class="text-content">
            <b>What math and physics concepts are used in this project? </b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp;We used the concept of pressure, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics.
        </p> 
        <p class="text-content">
            <b>What resources do you need for this project?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp;We need about 1.6E5 kg of plastic (PVC), unrustable metal for the heating section, and a very thin Filter as well as pH sensor.

            &emsp;If the installation is properly managed, then it could very well by a permanent solution.

            <b>How have you used local-thinking to develop your innovation?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; Our idea bloomed from the many floods happening in Somalia. We figured that, since the country suffers from a severe dehydration problem, we could reuse the floodwater for the locals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b>Is this innovation neutral and impartial (aka non-discriminatory)?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; While gender is not an issue, religion could be. Islam, the overwhelmingly main religion in Somalia, has very strict rules regarding water. The cleaned floodwater needs to reach a certain threshold of purity in order to not violate any Islamic principles.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b>Would you need to adapt this product/project if the issue were in a different culture?</b>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; The issue of water purity is not so much an issue of religion as it is a general healthcare issue. Thus, no matter the religion, the project’s idea and values will not change.

        <p class="section-title">Benefits, Drawbacks & Limitations</p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b> What potential harm/downsides could this innovation cause?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; There are a few drawbacks to our project that we need to acknowledge. Firstly, perhaps the most irking point, the installation of such a structure quite expensive – about $35000 dollars. Secondly, there is a real danger that the floodwater ends up being untreatable in some sections that are particularly affected by floods and severe droughts. Thorough analysis of the terrain is necessary to ensure the project’s well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b>What is the biggest benefit to this project?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; If successful, this project could potentially provide water to thousands of people a year, thus solving a major problem in Somalia. However, please remember that these predictions are for the absolute best-case scenario.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b>Who does this project affect?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; The installation of such a project could potentially create territorial issues. Water, being a scarce resource, is very-well capable of creating such conflicts between areas that have access to it and those who don’t. Unfortunately, this issue is hard to predict and control.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b> What are the limitations of this project</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; The heavy costs limits the amount of SomaWatt that we can realistically install in Somalia. Furthermore, as stated before, not every terrain is suited for such an installation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <b> How can this project be further improved?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            &emsp; In the future, more methods of water-control could be implemented to improve the floodwater’s quality. For instance, microplastic and carbon sensors, to identify whether or not the water is drinkable or not yet.
