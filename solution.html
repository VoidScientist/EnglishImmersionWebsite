        <p class="text-content">So our problem is that Somali people <b>can't properly access a water source.</b> There are two main problems with that:</p>
        <p class="text-content">&emsp; - People have <b>difficulties to use clean water</b> in their daily life.</p>
        <p class="text-content">&emsp; - It causes a second problem, <b>healthcare issue.</b> Indeed, if people can't properly access water, they <b>cannot drink enough</b>, wash their food, their hands as much as they need. They may use <b>dirty water</b> but the consequences are the same. People will get sick more often and <b>diseases will propagate much more</b> between people.</p>

        <p class="text-content">&emsp; That is why our solution are related with the <b>sixth SDG "Clean Water and sanitation"</b> and the <b>third "Good health and well-being".</b> SomaWatt will give a proper access to Somali people, and make life in Somalia <b>healthier for everyone</b>. Moreover we will <b>plant trees</b> so that the project is <b>fully sustainable</b>, so that Somalia gets water even if they do not maintain the containers.</p>
