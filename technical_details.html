        <p class="text-content"> &emsp; SomaWatt will have <b>3 safety measures.</b> It is composed of 1 filter, 2 cylinder, 1 pH sensor and solar panels. </p>
        <p class="text-content"> &emsp; The system will have <b>2 modes</b>, one to filter and collect the water and one to store it</p>
        <p class="text-content"> &emsp; When the <b>heavy rains arrives</b> we will put SomaWatt in the first mode, the population will have to <b>open the top of the storing cylinder</b> and add a filter. The filter is there to <b>limit the quantity of dirt</b> that will enter it. Once the rainy season has passed and <b>droughts hit the country</b>, the population can start using the water stored. This is the second mode.  We have 3 safety measures, the first one being the big filter, the 2nd one being a pH sensor to check the pH of the water and the last one is a heating cylinder to boil every bacteria to <b>make the water safe to drink.</b></p>
